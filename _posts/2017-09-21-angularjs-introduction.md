## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is AngularJS

**AngularJS is a full featured SPA framework** , and it is written in JavaScript. SPA stands for single page application it is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a fast user experience similar to that of a desktop application. SPA can be developed using any frameworks like EmberJS, MeteorJs, ReactJs and also with AngularJs.

AngularJS is a JavaScript MV structured framework to create dynamic web applications. AngularJS is open source, completely free and officially maintained by Google. 

AngularJS is no different from plain HTML, but an extensions to **HTML with new attributes** i.e using `ng-directives`.

Before writing any code first we need to download and import AngularJS library on our web page, then we extend HTML with angularjs directives.

We can also include AngularJS library from [CDN](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.5/angular.min.js).
