## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> AngularJS Number Expressions

Number expression as same as the javascript number expression. In short, if any expression using numbers and operators like +,-,/,* (add, subtract, divide, multiply) then those expressions are number expression.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> AngularJS example using number expressions.
**Example 1 :**
Here we are going to add two number .i.e 2 + 3 using number expressions. The code looks like as written below.

{% highlight html%}
{% raw %}
<div ng-app="">
	<p> Addition of 2 + 3 = {{ 2 + 3 }}</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


Same example can also be written using `ng-bind` directive in angularjs. Final code looks like as writte below.

```html
<div ng-app="">
	<p> Addition of 2 + 3 =  <span ng-bind="2 + 3"></span> </p>
</div>
```
**Output:** Addition of `2 + 3 = 5`
