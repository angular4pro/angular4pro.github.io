## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is ng-repeat directives?

In AngularJs the ng-repeat directive is used to loop through items in the collection of an element (DOM). The ng-repeat directive allows to iterate over a collection of data and print out DOM nodes that respond to that data. .i.e is similar to for loop.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> Example 1: AngularJS ng-repeat directive with Plain Array.

Here in this example first we initialize array variable ***names*** using ng-init, with some data .i.e (User Names). Now using ng-repeat directive will display each user name from that array list data. Our code looks like as written below.

```html {% raw %}
<div ng-app ng-init="names=['Amit sarna','Satinder singh','Sagar gada','Leslie mac','Andrea ely']">
    <ul>
        <li ng-repeat='x in names'>{{ x }}</li>        
    </ul>
</div>{% endraw %}    
```

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> Example 2: AngularJs ng-repeat directive with Array Of Objects

In the above example, we use ng-repeat with simple array and display username. Now here we are going to learn how to display data from Array of Object using ng-repeat directive. First, we have to initialize a variable ***mobileDetails*** which holds data ( array of object ) using ng-init same as the previous example. 

As you can see from following code that our data is about Mobile Name and its price, so will display it in tabular format .i.e column as mobile name, price. The final code looks like as written below.

```html {% raw %}
<div ng-app ng-init="mobileDetails=[{name:'iPhone 7' , price:'2000'},{name:'Moto G 5' , price:'800'},{name:'Galaxy S 8' , price:'1500'}]">
<table border="1">
        <tr><th>Model Name</th><th>Price</th></tr>
        <tr ng-repeat="item in mobileDetails">
            <td>{{ item.name }}</td>
            <td>{{ item.price }}</td>    
        </tr>
    </table>
</div> {% endraw %}
```
