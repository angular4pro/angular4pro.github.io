## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is ng-show and ng-hide in Angularjs ?
In Angularjs with directives we can do things like DOM Manipulation, Data Binding and handle Events. AngularJs provide two directives `ng-show` and `ng-hide` which is used to change the visibility (show/hide) of HTML element. As in single page application (SPA) we want to display different views based on condition. Thus agularjs provide direct `ng-show` and `ng-hide` directive so we dont need to use css or javascipt to hide/show specific elements. **ng-show** used to show the HTML element only if the expression evaluates to true. And **ng-hide** is the opposite of 'ng-show' i.e used to hide the html element.
