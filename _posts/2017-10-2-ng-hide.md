## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is ng-show and ng-hide in Angularjs ?
In Angularjs with directives, we can do things like DOM Manipulation, Data Binding and handle Events. AngularJs provide two directives `ng-show` and `ng-hide` which is used to change the visibility (show/hide) of HTML element. As in single page application (SPA), we want to display different views based on condition. Thus angularjs provide direct `ng-show` and `ng-hide` directive, so we don't need to use CSS or javascript to hide/show specific elements. 

Directive **ng-show** is used to show the HTML element only if the expression evaluates to true. And **ng-hide** is the opposite of `ng-show` i.e., used to hide the HTML element.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> Example : Using ng-show in Angularjs.

Here in this example will see a simple use of ng-show directive to display divs. We have 3 Checkboxes as red, green, blue, with respective Divs. Now on checkbox checked will display individual div. Heres the magic of AngularJS .i.e without writing any javascript code or applying any CSS we able to show or hide our HTML content. Just my adding attribute ng-show to our HTML markup we able to display respective divs.

```html {% raw %}
<div ng-app>
    Red <input type="Checkbox" ng-model='myRed' > 
    Green <input type="Checkbox" ng-model='myGreen' > 
    Blue <input type="Checkbox" ng-model='myBlue' > 

    <div ng-show="myRed" style="background-color: red; color: white;">
        <h3>This is RED</h3>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div ng-show="myGreen"  style="background-color: green;color: white;">
        <h3>This is RED</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div ng-show="myBlue"  style="background-color: blue;color: white;">
        <h3>This is RED</h3>
    </div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```
