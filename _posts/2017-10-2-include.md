## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is ng-include directives in Angularjs?
The **ng-include** directives is used to ***add external html file into the main HTML pages***. i.e we can embed HTML pages within a HTML pages. This directives can be used to ***inject angular code from external files*** into our main HTML page.

If we have an HTML page which contains some logic written in angularjs code, and we want that logic in another page. Then using `ng-include`, we can achieve it. 

The default behavior of using `ng-include` will only work, if the included file would be from the **same domain** else ng-include will not work. To use `ng-include` with **cross domain**, we need to add a whitelist of legal files or domains in the config function on our application.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> Example: Using ng-include directive in AngularJs?
Here in this example, we have two HTML files, i.e., menu.html and main.html. In the menu.html page we have added some menus, and using `ng-include` we will display its content on our main.html page. The final code looks like as written below.

```html {% raw %} 
<!-- menu.html -->

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Menu one</li>
        <li>Menu two</li>
        <li>Menu three</li>
        <li>Menu four</li>
    </ul>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

```html {% raw %} 
<!-- main.html -->

<div ng-app="myApp">
    <div ng-include="'menu.html'"></div>
    This is our content blah blah

</div>{% endraw %}
```
