## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is ng-class directives in Angularjs ?
In angularjs with `ng-class` directive, we can dynamically ***add or remove CSS class*** to the HTML element, also based on some condition. We can add one or more CSS classes at a time using **ng-class** directive. We can add/ remove CSS classes based on an angular variable, based on expressions, and based on dynamic data.

### The ng-class directive values can be a string value, an object or an array.
 1. **String:** If it is string value it should have at least one class name, and for adding multiple class we can add space between each class name.
 2. **Object:** If it is an object, it needs to be the Key-Value pair, where the key represents the class name and value is the boolean value. I.e.,  if the boolean value set to true, then only the class gets added.
 3. **Array:** If it is an array, it can be a combination of both ***String*** and ***Object***
