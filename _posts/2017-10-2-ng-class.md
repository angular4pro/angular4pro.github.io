## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right color"></i> What is ng-class directives in Angularjs ?
In angularjs with `ng-class` directive, we can dynamically ***add or remove CSS class*** to the HTML element, also based on some condition. We can add one or more CSS classes at a time using **ng-class** directive. We can add/ remove CSS classes based on angular variable, based on expressions, and based on dynamic data.

### The ng-class directive values can be a string value, an object or an array.
 1. **String:** If it is string value it should have atleast one class name, and for adding multiple class we can add space between each class name.
 2. **Object:** If it is object, it need to be Key Value pair, where the key represent the class name and value is boolean value. i.e  if the boolean value set to true, then only the class gets added.
 3. **Array:** If it is an array, it can be a combination of both ***String*** and ***Object***
